          <p>
            I am Roxane Jett, a storyteller guided by faith and fueled by the
            warmth of family. My journey into the enchanting realm of children's
            literature was sparked by a profound belief in the power of positive
            change. Inspired by the Change Agent and the Rising Leader program,
            I set out to make a positive impact on the world, one person at a
            time.

            instilling hope and joy in the hearts of children has not gone
            unnoticed. Participating in the Change Agent and the Rising Leader
            program has been instrumental in shaping my narrative approach. My
            aspiration is to contribute to a brighter, happier world, one person
            at a time.
